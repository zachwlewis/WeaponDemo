Weapons, Bullets and Players
=============================

Properly setting up a game with these objects.
----------------------------------------------

With this project, I have attempted to create an extensible framework for creating a 2D game involving moving, shooting and multiple weapons.

A few of the key things to notice are:

* Weapon is its own class, completely seperate of Player.
* Bullet is its own class, completely seperate of Weapon.
* Weapon is an Entity. This allows ease of access to FP.elapsed (to handle the weapon's rate of fire).
* Proper techniques were used in creating key handling in Player.
* Weapons can be on their own. Think about attaching them to a turret and letting a Player colliding with it to be able to call the Weapon's shoot function. Cool, huh?

I hope this helps some people. If you need more help, or if anything is confusing, email me, or leave me a message.
